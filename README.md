# Samuel Adu-Berekorang's Code Playground: Where AI Meets Ambition

üëã Yo! I'm Samuel, a self-taught developer with a relentless drive to push the boundaries of AI and Web 3. This playground is my digital laboratory, where I tinker with code, build mind-blowing projects, and (hopefully) impress you with my problem-solving skills.

## What's cookin' in the lab?

### AI Mavericks
Meet my AI creations:
- **WMS**: StaGreen's AI solution for Urban Planning & Waste Management.
- **Image Recognition and Classification System**: Built with Custom Vision, it performs cool object detection that'll blow your mind.

### Web 3 Warriors
Witness my foray into the decentralized world:
- **DApp**: Building using Ethereum and Solidity.
- **Blockchain-based Voting System**: A secure system that'll make democracy a breeze (well, almost!). 


## Hungry for More Knowledge?

My relentless pursuit of learning doesn't stop at code. Check out my certifications that prove I'm always one step ahead:

- **AI Certified Foundations Associate** (Oracle University, June 2024)
- **Data Science Foundations (Level 1)** (IBM, June 2023)
- **Advanced Google Analytics** (Google, June 2023)
- **Foundations of Project Management** (Google, July 2023)

## Let's Collab!

I'm not a lone coder on a deserted island (although that does sound kinda cool...). Find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-adu-berekorang) and let's chat about AI, Web 3, or the best places to find pizza in Accra! üçï

## Stay Tuned!

This playground is constantly under construction, with new projects and updates popping up like mushrooms after a good rain. So, bookmark this page and come back often! üåü

## Wanna Play Along?

Feedback and contributions are always welcome! Open an issue or pull request and let's build something awesome together.
